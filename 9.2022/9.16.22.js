var laLigaGoals = 43
var championsLeagueGoals = 10
var copaDelReyGoals = 5

var totalGoals = laLigaGoals + championsLeagueGoals + copaDelReyGoals

// Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

// Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

// If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
// If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

      "Keep at it until you get it";
