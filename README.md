This is a repo of daily challenges that I'm holding myself to forseeable future. 
Some days I do one and if I found the challenge to be easy for me I do one or two more.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Nothing Crazy here, just putting the challenges in a JS file and pushing.

## Lessons Learned:

I've started implementing the PREP (Parameters, Return, Examples, Pseudocode) to help me work through a given challenge. 
Sometimes I find it difficult to use PREP when I'm uncertain of what the next step is, but that's what its for! 
Using it helps me talk out the problem to myself and will help me better talk out problems with other engineers.
